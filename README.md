## Algorist-Toolbox
A collection of **Jupyter Notebooks** focused on providing an intuitive understanding of key ideas & principles.  We use Jupyter Notebooks to enhance the learning experience by separating code from pro's but giving proper attention to the requirement for exploring concepts with enhance descriptions and articulations. Further, we can __pictoraly illustrate__ Time Complexities and Key ideas using libraries like `plotly` or `matplotlib` with enhanced `pandas` features.

## Setup
1. Run `./setup.sh`
    - Ensure you see the environment activated in your IDE.
    - ****WARNING**** : If you're using _**VSCode**_ You'll have to close and re-open the IDE due to a bug in VSCode regarding Jupyter Notebook Kernel setups before the setup changes will be seen.
    - Re-activate the environment if you had to re-open the IDE. `source env/bin/activate`
2. Open any Jupyter Notebook and select the Kernel **before** running any code.
3. Choose `algorist-toolbox` Kernel from the dropdown menu.
4. Run any code & have fun ðŸ˜Š
