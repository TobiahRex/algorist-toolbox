    "# Permutations of List\n",

    "### Time Complexity Intuition\n",
    "1. This is not exactly an n-choose-k problem. Rather it's a **permutation** problem, with a twist. **Permutations** take into account elements of different sizes. In this case, we're collecting answers with the same size. To determine the total number of answers we're looking for, we can use the formula below.\n",

    "    - Looking at the bottom formula in the top photo, we can see how similar this expression is to the nCk expression, but slightly different as it's missing the second `k!`.\n",

    "0. Clue 1. Given that the solution requires N! time, we know we're going to need some type of tree. We can also realize that our work per-tree level is going to decrease by k, as k increases.  So if we think of the Tree structure in terms as always\n",

    "    - > How many branches per level?\n",

    "1. Clue 2. Given we'll have a varying amount of branches per level, we know we need a loop per node.\n",
    "2. Clue 3. Given that we know k should decrease per factor, we know the loop's size decreases depending on it's level in the tree, which means, it's length depends on some input."
