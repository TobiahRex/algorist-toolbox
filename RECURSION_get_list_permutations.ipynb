    "- Uses a __slate__ as a global-variable and inserts the Tree-Node's result into the slate on every Manager's call.\n",
    "Further, this slate uses a Dynamically adjusted __divider__ within the slate to logically separate 2 individual\n",
    "pieces of state; 1. __slate__, 2. Elements not within the __slate__.\n",
    "- Uses a loop at each node, therefore the conceptual understanding is NOT a tree, just a callstack.\n",
    "    * More on this in the **Take Away** section.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Control Flow\n",
    "1. The **base case** is to check if the __slate__ is full. If so, then we've reached a leaf-node within the tree and we've completed the task of generating an answer. Append contents of the slate to the results.\n",
    "2. Each **manager** / **node** will have the job of iterating through the sub-section of the numbers that are to the _right_ of the slate's divider.\n",
    "    - This loops will run n-l times (n = # of elements, l = Tree-Level).\n",
    "3. Within this loop, we perform 3 operations.\n",
    "4. _First_: We swap the i'th element from our current scope'd loop, with the value adjacent to the slate's current divider position. See example below"

    "    `pos` is describing the divider's current position. `0 to pos - 1` = All elements **within** the slate. And `pos to len(array)`  = All elements outside the slate.\n",
    "5. After we've called recursively and eventually arrived at a leaf node, we'll retrace to a previous call, and undo the swap we made. Then we'll iterate through the Node's loop, and swap again.\n",
    "6. On a high-level, we should think of separation of concerns as follows\n",
    "    - Tree-Level-Work:\n",
    "        * Decide the size of the slate we're filling by fixing the slate-divider location.\n",
